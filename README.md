# IDEA
The cs50 staff of the Harvard University has written a library called 'cs50.h'. This library is written in the C-language so that you can use it in C++ as well. But I asked myself, if C++ gives the programmer the possibility to write a library with the same functions but with improved performance, easier usage and improved maintainability. With this overloaded template function in my header file I hope, that my aims were reached.
